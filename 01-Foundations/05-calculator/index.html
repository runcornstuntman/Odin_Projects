    <!-- 
    Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit and operator (including =).
    Don’t worry about making them functional just yet.
    There should also be a display for the calculator. Go ahead and fill it with some dummy numbers 
    so it looks correct.
    Add a “clear” button.
    Create the functions that populate the display when you click the digit buttons. You should store
     the content of the display (the number) in a variable for use in the next step. -->

     <!-- 
     Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first and second numbers input by the user and
      then operate() on them when the user presses the = button, according to the operator that was 
      selected between the numbers.You should already have the code that can populate the display, so 
      once operate has been called, update the display with the result of the operation.This is the 
      hardest part of the project. You need to figure out how to store all the values and call the operate 
      function with them. Don’t feel bad if it takes you a while to figure out the logic. -->

    Extra credit
    Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them
     in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one 
     though, like: 12.3.56.5. Disable the . button if there’s already a decimal separator in the display.
    Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo their last input if they click the wrong number.
    Add keyboard support! -->
